# Reminder
The simplest reminder app written in Python. The job of it is as simple as the code- to notify you every N hour with your desired message.

Wrote it to remind me to do something every n minutes as I was not finding any app to do it except task schedulers, and task scheduler was an overkill for doing this. So why not write a program myself?
